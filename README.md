# BoardGameReviewPredictor
Give a data set of over 80k board games. We need to develop an algorithm which is able to accurately predict the score that game will receive. In this project I have used Linear Regression, Decision Tree and K-neighbor algorithm to train the individual models  and then used ensemble technique to get the best accuracy.
